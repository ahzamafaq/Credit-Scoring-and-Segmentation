# Credit-Scoring-and-Segmentation
  Developed a **Credit Scoring and Segmentation** system to calculate credit scores for individuals using a custom formula based on payment history, credit utilization, and other factors. Segmented customers into groups (e.g., "Excellent," "Low") using K-Means clustering, visualizing results with Seaborn.
